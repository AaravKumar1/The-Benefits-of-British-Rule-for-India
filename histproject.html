        <h2>
            In the Cause of Humanity: Abolition of sati and infanticide. Destruction of Gangs, Thugs, and
other such pests of Indian society. Allowing remarriage of Hindu widows. 
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>
            In the Cause of Civilization: Education, both male and female, though yet only partial. Leading
gradually to the destruction of superstition, and many moral and social evils. Resuscitation of
India's own noble literature, refined by the enlightenment of the West. 
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Politically: Peace and order. Freedom of speech and press. Higher political knowledge and
aspirations. Improvement of government in the native states. Security of life and property.
Services of educated administrators, who have achieved these results.

        <h2>
            Materially: Loans for railways and irrigation. Development of a few valuable products, such as
indigo, tea, coffee, silk, etc. Increase of exports. Telegraphs.  
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Generally: Growing desire to treat India equitably. Good intentions. No nation on earth has ever
had the opportunity of achieving such a glorious work. If I have omitted any item of importance,
I will gladly insert it. I appreciate what England has done for India, and I know that it is only in
British hands that her glory can be accomplished.

        <h2>
            In the Cause of Humanity: Nothing. Everything is in your favor under this heading
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>
            In the Cause of Civilization: There has been a failure to do as much as might have been done, but
I complain not. Much has been done, though. 
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Politically: Repeated break of pledges to give Indians a fair share in the administration of their
own country, which has much shaken confidence in the good faith of the British word. An utter
disregard of the feelings and views of the natives.
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Financially: All attention is paid on new taxes without any effort to increase the means of the
people to pay; and the consequent vexation and oppressiveness of the taxes imposed, imperial
and local. Inequitable financial relations between England and India. 
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Materially: The impoverishment of the country, except it has been partly relieved and
replenished by the railway and irrigation loans, and the American war, since 1850. Even with
this relief, the poor have hardly a daily meal and a few rags to wear. The famines they could
have prevented, if they had done their duty, as an intelligent government. An increase of exports
without compensation; loss of manufacturing industry and skill.

        <h2>
            British rule has been: morally, a great blessing; politically, peace and order on one
hand, blunders on the other; materially, hunger. The natives call the British system "Sakar ki
Churi," or the “knife of sugar.” In other words there is no oppression, it is all smooth and sweet,
but it is the knife. I say this that you should know these feelings. You do not know our wants.
When you will know our real wishes, I have not the least doubt that you would do justice. The
genius and spirit of the British people is fair play and justice.
